# Walkthrough of RNA-seq Analysis Workflow in a *De Novo* Transcriptome Assembly

> This walkthrough showcases the key steps used during my M.Sc. research on plant specialized metabolism in *Tacca chantrieri*. It is designed for biology researchers, graduate students, and anyone new to RNA-seq bioinformatics. Oftentimes like in my case genomes are not available in non-model organisms, requiring a thorough transcriptomic profiling without the use of a genome, hence why no emphasis was made on genome alignment here.
